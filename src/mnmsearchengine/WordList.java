   This program lets the user specify a text file for input and a file
   for output.  All the words are read from the input file.  Words are
   converted to lower case.  An alphabetical list of all the words that
   were found, without repetition, is written to the output file, with
   one word per line.  A word in this program is defined to be any
   sequence of letters.

   This class depends on the non-standard classes TextIO and TextReader,
